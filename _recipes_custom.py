# Only mobi work as periodicals on the Kindle
# Notes:
#   - When epub is converted to mobi periodicals:
#       - masthead is lost
#       - mobi retains periodical support but has the non-functional
#         calibre generated nav, e.g. Next Section, Main, etc
#       - article summary/description is lost
#   - When mobi periodical is converted to epub:
#       - epub loses the calibre generated nav, e.g. Next Section, Main, etc
#         but full toc is retained
#   - Recipe can be defined twice with different src_ext, will work except
#     for potential throttling and time/bandwidth taken
